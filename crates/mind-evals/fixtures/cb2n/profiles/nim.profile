# cb2n profile "nim" (E.CB2-N): NVIDIA NIM upstream, its IPv4 addresses resolved on the box ONCE
# per run into the immutable run state (allowlisted exclusively, recorded in every receipt); the
# key file (uid 10002, mode 0400) mounted read-only into the PROXY container only and injected as
# the Authorization header on every forward; both work containers hold placeholder keys. One
# model for both systems. The Mind runs with YM_PRIMARY_BRAIN=nim:<model> and all six roles equal
# to it, behind YM_PROVIDER_BASE_URL_NIM (the proxy).
